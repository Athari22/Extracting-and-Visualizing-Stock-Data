# Extracting and Visualizing Stock-Data
##Project Overview
This project is a part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate] (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

##Description:
The idea of the project is to work for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. The job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop
